### Roadmap

- Routing

- Setting Page in which you can change font, colors and account details
- localStorage in which you will store all data 
- implementation of TS

### Notes

This was first project that I did and it's not pretty. As such, project is fairly simple which is
why I decided to implement TS in it. Also, will need to play around with Player Two. I want to create Player Two that
will play by itself, so whenever you decide to play, you will have an opponent!
