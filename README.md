<h1>Tic-Tac-Toe with React.js</h1>

<p>
Tic Tac Toe project done only with React.js. It was not a difficult project at first, but implementing game design 
qualities as Start component and Replay component, did not make it easy project either.

I did use this chance in order to practice Ref Hook, so it's okeyish considering the effort done.

Next, should be doing this same project with Redux and React Router. 

Well, onwards to the next project!

P.S.  I totally forgot to add media queries to this project, which is fixed now. So, next time I am on break, I am playing this game!!! :D
Also, this game is getting account creation, settings. At this time, I am learning Backend with Node.js, so the moment I am done with it, I will be "upgrading" my projects!
